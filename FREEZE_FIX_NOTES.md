# ðŸ”§ ADMIN CONSOLE FREEZE FIX

## Issue
The admin console was freezing when clicking the "Edit" button.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Infinite Re-renders Prevention**
- Added state management to prevent multiple simultaneous save operations
- Implemented `isModalLoading` state to block duplicate form submissions
- Added object copying in `handleEdit` to avoid reference issues

### 2. **Error Boundaries**
- Created `AdminErrorBoundary` component to catch React errors that could cause freezing
- Wrapped all admin components in error boundaries for better isolation
- Added detailed error logging and recovery options

### 3. **Enhanced State Management**
- Improved cancel handler with proper state cleanup
- Added loading states to prevent button mashing
- Enhanced form submission protection

### 4. **Better User Feedback**
- Disabled buttons during loading operations
- Added "Saving..." state indicators
- Enhanced console logging with visual indicators

## Files Modified

1. **RoomsManager.tsx**
   - Added `isModalLoading` state
   - Enhanced `handleEdit` with object copying
   - Improved `handleSaveEdit` with loading protection
   - Added robust `handleCancelEdit` function

2. **EditRoomModal.tsx**
   - Added `isLoading` prop support
   - Enhanced form submission protection
